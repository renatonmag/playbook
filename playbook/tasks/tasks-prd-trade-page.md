# Task List: Trade Page Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/routes/trade.tsx` - Main trade page route component
- `src/stores/tradeStore.ts` - Store for managing trading lanes state
- `src/components/TradeLane.tsx` - Individual trading lane component
- `src/components/TradeLaneHeader.tsx` - Header component for each lane with title and delete button
- `src/components/TradePage.tsx` - Main container component for the trade page
- `src/components/TradePage.test.tsx` - Unit tests for TradePage component
- `src/components/TradeLane.test.tsx` - Unit tests for TradeLane component
- `src/components/TradeLaneHeader.test.tsx` - Unit tests for TradeLaneHeader component
- `src/stores/tradeStore.test.ts` - Unit tests for trade store

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
