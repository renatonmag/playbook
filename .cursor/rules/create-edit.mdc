# Rule: Generating a Feature Edit Task List

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Feature Edit Task List in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The Task should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Generate Document:** Based on the initial prompt, generate a Document with steps to implement the user request. Use the structure bellow.
3.  **Save Document:** Save the generated document as `edit-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Document structure

[ ] 1 - Major task 1
[ ] 1.1 - Sub-task 1.1
[ ] 1.2 - Sub-task 1.2
[ ] 1.3 - Sub-task 1.3
[ ] 2 - Major task 2
[ ] 2.1 - Sub-task 2.1
[ ] 2.2 - Sub-task 2.2
[ ] 2.3 - Sub-task 2.3

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the FRD is a **senior developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `edit-[feature-name].md`

## Final instructions

1. **Do NOT** start implementing the Document
