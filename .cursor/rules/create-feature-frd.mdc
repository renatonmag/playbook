# Rule: Generating a Feature Requirements Document (FRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Feature Requirements Document (FRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The FRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI _must_ ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the feature do not start implementing it. Format the clarifying questions like

Area 1
1.1 Area 1 sub topic 1
1.2 Area 1 sub topic 2
Area 2
2.1 Area 2 sub topic 1
2.2 Area 2 sub topic 2

5.  **Generate FRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a FRD using the structure outlined below.
6.  **Save FRD:** Save the generated document as `frd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:

- **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
- **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
- **Data Requirements:** "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"

## FRD Structure

The generated FRD should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.
3.  **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
4.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will _not_ include to manage scope.
5.  **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the FRD is a **senior developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `frd-[feature-name].md`

## Final instructions

1. **Do NOT** start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the FRD
